- Debt encouragement or irresponsible spending messaging
- Unsubstantiated guarantees

*Brand Voice:*

**EXAMPLES OF QUALITY:**

Strong segment alignment:
- Speaks directly to segment's unique situation
- Uses their language and values
- Feels custom-written, not template-based

Weak segment alignment:
- Generic messaging
- Could apply to anyone
- Misses key segment motivators

Strong offer disclosure:
- "3% cash back on gas and dining, 2% on groceries, 1% on all other purchases"
- "$300 bonus after you spend $3,000 in first 3 months"
- "No annual fee for the first year, then $95/year"

Weak offer disclosure:
- "Great rewards on purchases"
- "$300 welcome bonus" (missing threshold)
- "No annual fee" (when ongoing fee exists)

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**

Return a valid JSON object:
{
  "subject_line": "your subject line here",
  "body_text": "your email body here",
  "cta": "your call-to-action here"
}
